# [Implement interfaces in TypeScript](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/typescript-implement-interfaces/)

JavaScript doesn't support interfaces so, as a JavaScript developer, you may or may not have experience with them. 

In TypeScript, you can use interfaces as you would in traditional object-oriented programming. 

You can also use interfaces to define object types and this is the primary focus of this module.

In this module, you will learn how to:

- Explain the reasons for using an interface in TypeScript.
- Declare and instantiate an interface.
- Extend an interface.
- Declare an interface with custom array types.
