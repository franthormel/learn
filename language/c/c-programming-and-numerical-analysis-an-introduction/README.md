# C Programming and Numerical Analysis: An Introduction
## Book by Seiichi Nomura
### **Abstract**
This book is aimed at those in engineering/scientific fields who have never learned programming before but are eager to master the C language quickly so as to immediately apply it to problem solving in numerical analysis. 

The book skips unnecessary formality but explains all the important aspects of C essential for numerical analysis. Topics covered in numerical analysis include single and simultaneous equations, differential equations, numerical integration, and simulations by random numbers.

In the Appendices, quick tutorials for gnuplot, Octave/MATLAB, and FORTRAN for C users are provided.
