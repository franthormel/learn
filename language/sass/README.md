# Sass

This guide is taken from the [Sass Basics guide](https://sass-lang.com/guide)

To complile a Sass file to CSS use:

```
sass input.sass output.css --watch
```

You can omit the **--watch** flag if you do not want to use *hot-reloading*

More flags are available [here](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass).
